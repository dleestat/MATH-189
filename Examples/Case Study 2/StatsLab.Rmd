```{r, include=FALSE, results="hide"}
## Download necessary packages

# Install gmodels for cross-tabulation
install.packages('gmodels', repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
```

# Data Management
Loading data from current directory
```{r}
data <- read.table("videodata.txt", header=TRUE)
data.population <- 314     # True population
data.samples <- 91         # Number of samples
head(data)
summary(data)
```


## Cleaning Data
Replacing 99 values (the unanswered/improper results) with NAs
```{r}
data[data == 99] <- NA
numSamples <- NROW(data)
head(data)
summary(data)
```



# Scenario 1

## Sample Proportion of Students Who Played a Video Game in the Last Week
The individual variables measured here are Bernoulli since time is being converted to a binary 'did' or 'did not' play.
```{r}
# Create 'numPlayers' variable to count number of players in the last week.
# This is done by counting the number of people with time spent over 0, which represents the
# people who played something in the last week since they spent time on it. 0 indicates no time 
# spent.
numPlayers <- NROW(which(data$time > 0))
paste("Number of players:", numPlayers, sep=" ")

# Sample proportion is the ratio of numPlayers to total students (rows in data)
data.playersSampleProportion <- (numPlayers/numSamples)
paste("Sample proportion:", data.playersSampleProportion, sep=" ")

```


## Players Sample Proportion Confidence Interval
Since the sample Bernoulli variables are NOT identically independentally distributed, the confidence interval itself will be computed utilizing the finite population correction factor.
```{r}
# Sample proportion is nearly Binomial, except not iid.
playersCorrectionFactor <- sqrt((data.population - numSamples)/data.population)
# Binomial standard error formula without correction
playersIndepStandardError <-  (sqrt(data.playersSampleProportion*(1-data.playersSampleProportion))/sqrt(numSamples - 1))
# Standard error with finite population correction
data.playersStandardErrorEstimate <- playersIndepStandardError*playersCorrectionFactor
paste("Corrected Standard Error:", data.playersStandardErrorEstimate, sep=" ")

# Since the sample proportion follows a normal distribution by the Central Limit Theorem,
# we need to multiply the corrected standard error by 1.96 to generate the interval.
data.playersMarginOfError <- 1.96*data.playersStandardErrorEstimate
paste("Margin of Error: ", data.playersMarginOfError, sep="")

# Therefore, the confidence interval:
playersLowerBound <- data.playersSampleProportion - data.playersMarginOfError
playersUpperBound <- data.playersSampleProportion + data.playersMarginOfError
data.playersSampleProportionConf95 <- c(playersLowerBound, playersUpperBound)
paste("Player Proportion 95% CI: ", "(",playersLowerBound, ", ", playersUpperBound,")", sep="")
```


# Scenario 2

# Scenario 3
```{r}
#First we calculate the estimate for the # of students that played a video game:
nogame.ind <- which(data['time'] == 0.0) #Identify those who did not play video games the week prior
data.nogame <- data[nogame.ind,] #Create a data frame with no gamers
n1 <- length(data.nogame$time) #Calculates the # of students that played video games

#Histogram of sample time spent playing

     col = 4, density = 15, breaks = 15)

#Here we do Bootstrap
boot.population <- rep(data$time, length.out = 314) #Creates the population

# Scenario 4
Getting proportion who likes games.
```{r}
# Initializing variables corresponding to responses from students on the survey
likeVeryMuch <- 2
likeSomewhat <- 3
# Fetching all students who responded with positive game likeness

# Scenario 5
```{r}
# Using gmodels library
library(gmodels)

#Cross-Tabulation for owning a computer/like playing games
CrossTable(data$like, data$own)

#Cross-Tabulation for working/like playing games
CrossTable(data$like, data$work==0)

#Cross-Tabultion for sex/like playing games

# Scenario 6
```{r}
#Chi-square test
